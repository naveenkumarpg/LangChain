# LangChain

LangChain is a OpenSource framework that allows developers with AI to combine LLM's with external source of computation and data
LangChain is Data-aware and Agentic-aware

What LangChain can be used for

- Chat Bots
- Q&A Systems
- Summarization tools

### LangChain Main Concepts

1. **LangChain components**

   1. **LLM Wrappers** - Allow us to connect to LLM's
   2. **Prompt** templates - Dynamic prompts that are inputs to LLM's
   3. **Indexes** - allows extract relent information
   4. **Memory** - storing and retrieving the data in the conversation

2. **Chains** - Allows us to combine multiple components together to solve a specific task and build an entire LLM application

3. **Agents** - Agents are enabling tools for LLM's. agents Facilitate interaction btwn llm and external api's. they play a crucial role in decision making detraining which actions the LLM should undertake
